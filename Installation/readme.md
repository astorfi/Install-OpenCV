<header align="center">## OpenCV Anaconda installation in Ubuntu This tutorial deals with OpenCV 3.1 installation for Anaconda in Ubuntu 16.04.</header>

## Introduction **OpenCV 3.1** has been developed as the newest version of OpenCV library and it's been widely used so far. **Anacaconda** has a pretty nice easy-to-use environment in which almost all the necessary Python packages are installed and it is rapidly growing. Although OpenCV installation for anaconda has been compiled but it has different issues when it comes to integrate it with ubuntu specially if one needs to have its complete features and specially the video support. For having the all features of OpenCV, it needs to be installed from the source. There are few anaconda installations guide for OpenCV 3.1 but still it seems to be a tricky problem specially when using virtual environments is desired. There might be a misunderstanding about the naming convention of OpenCV3 which is its relevance to Python3 which is wrong. OpenCV3(version 3.1 as an example) works with both Python generations like **Python 2.7** and **Python 3.5** in the same way. However in this tutorial the Python3 is considered as a more recent choice by the programmers. Unless otherwise mentioned, the assumption is that all the commands will be executed in the <span class="inner_shadow">Root</span> directory. From any other directories, by using the <span class="inner_shadow">cd ~</span> command we go to the root directory. ## Virtual Environment In this section the method for creating the virtual environment in Anaconda will be described. One may ask how to create Python virtual environments rather than the Anaconda virtual environments. There is nice documentation about [Python Virtual Environments](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/workflow/virtual_pythons.html) in the hyperlink however it is related to Python environment itself. Creating virtual environment in Anaconda is much easier though. ### Advantages of Working on Virtual Environments The main advantage of using virtualenvs is to separate different projects environments in which using different Python versions or packages are desired. For illustration let's assume some packages have conflict and also both are required for different separated projects. In this manner, different projects can be developed in different environments and here's the virtual environments come to our rescue. Moreover creating virtual environments enrich the user with creating a new environment so not to corrupt any of the root packages. There is another strong point. Installing packages and managing the conflicts in virtual environments is much easier than the general environment because from the beginning the procedure of installing dependencies is at hand. ### Creating Virtual Environments Although creating virtual environments in anaconda is very easy, however there exits some considerations and a procedure for sure! #### Step#1: Check Installation First of all, Anaconda has to be in the PATH. Type the following in the terminal to do so:

<div class="shell-wrap">Add Anaconda to the PATH * export PATH="PATH=/home/username/anaconda/bin:$PATH"</div>

The element of "username" is specific to the system. Now you can check if the Anaconda is in the path or not with checking the full PATH by using following command:

<div class="shell-wrap">PATH Check * echo $PATH <out>/home/sina/anaconda/bin:/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin:/home/sina/bin:/home/sina/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin</out></div>

More over the installed Conda version can be checked to make sure the Anaconda is already installed and is updated.

<div class="shell-wrap">Check Installation * conda update conda * conda info <out>platform : linux-64 conda version : 4.3.9 conda is private : False conda-env version : 4.3.9 conda-build version : not installed python version : 2.7.13.final.0 requests version : 2.12.4</out></div>

After verifying the installation, the next step is to create the virtual environment with the desired command. #### Step#2: Creating Virtual Environment For Installing _Python 3.5_ in the Anaconda virtualenv, the following command should be executed in the command line.

<div class="shell-wrap">Virtualenv Creation * conda create -n Virtualenv_Name python=3.5 anaconda</div>

The <span class="inner_shadow">Virtualenv_Name</span> is the associated name for the virtual environment. Different Python versions can be installed by just changing the version number assigned in the command. The virtual environment is chosen to be <span class="inner_shadow">py3k</span> for our distribution. #### Step#3: Activate Environment The next step is to activate environment. After activation, all packages will be installed within the virtual environment and the workflow will be executed there too. The command to activate the virtual environment named _py3k_ is as follows:

<div class="shell-wrap">Virtualenv Creation * source activate py3k</div>

After the activation, the sign of the environment should appear in the command line. The screen will be something similar to the below image:

<div align="center">

<div id="figure1" class="responsive" style="padding: 0 6px;width: 80%;">

<div class="img">[![Linkedin](../../../_images/topics/computer_vision/installation/opencv/env-activated.png)](../../../_images/topics/computer_vision/installation/opencv/env-activated.png)

<div class="desc">**Figure 1:** The virtual environment indicator is active.</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<u>_There is a caveat for working in virtual environments_</u>. Although the workspace is the virtual environment, if the user apply <span class="inner_shadow">Sudo</span> command for any installation, the process will target the system root and not the virtual environment. This point is crucial because it is common mistake and cannot be easily recognized. #### Step#4: Deactivation For deactivating the virtual environment the following command can simply be employed:

<div class="shell-wrap">Deactivation of Virtual Environment * source deactivate</div>

## Installing dependencies Loosely speaking, installing the dependencies is the main part of OpenCV installation. The reason is OpenCV requires a lot of packages to be installed. So the system architecture must provide every single dependencies that it needs. moreover if installing extra OpenCV modules is desired, it certainly adds to the number of requirements. This section is aimed to describe what are these requirements. ### I - System Update First of all, the system packages should be updated to their latest version. <span class="inner_shadow">sudo apt-get update</span> downloads the package lists from the repositories and "updates" them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. <span class="inner_shadow">sudo apt-get upgrade</span> will fetch new versions of packages existing on the machine if APT knows about these new versions by way of apt-get update[ [Reference](http://askubuntu.com/questions/222348/what-does-sudo-apt-get-update-do) ].

<div class="shell-wrap">Sysytem Update * sudo apt-get update * sudo apt-get upgrade</div>

Building tools must be installed first. The <span class="inner_shadow">build-essentials</span> is a reference for any Debian package requirements. It generally includes the gcc/g++ compilers as libraries and is necessary if any C/C++ compiler is included in the requirements. If any packages is desired to be compiled from it source then <span class="inner_shadow">pkg-config</span> is required which is our case in OpenCV installation. <span class="inner_shadow">cmake</span> manages and execute the build process of OpenCV. <span class="inner_shadow">cmake-curses-gui</span> installs the **ccmake** which is the handy GUI for the cmake configuration process!

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">Build Essentials * sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config cmake cmake-curses-gui</div>

### II - Installing Python libraries Of course python is required for installing OpenCV. Moreover installing some famous packages as <span class="inner_shadow">Numpy</span> and <span class="inner_shadow">Scipy</span> is of great important for any computer vision library. <span class="inner_shadow">python-dev</span> basically contains the header files which are necessary to build Python extensions.

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">Python Libraries * sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy * sudo apt-get install python-scipy</div>

### III - Installing GUI libraries OpenCV employs the HighGUI library("high-level graphical user interface") to open windows, display, read and write images and videos and etc. This library(HighGUI) needs a backend to operate. There are two available backend for HighGUI. One is the <span class="inner_shadow">Qt</span> library which can be installed as follows:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">Qt Backend for HighGUI * sudo apt-get install qt5-default * sudo apt-get install libqt5opengl5-dev</div>

Moreover the <span class="inner_shadow">GTK</span> library can be used as the backend too. The installation command is as follows:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">Qt Backend for HighGUI * sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev * sudo apt-get install libgtkglext1 libgtkglext1-dev</div>

### III - Installing image processing libraries OpenCV is at first an image processing and manipulation library. The primitive ability for that is to load/save images. Moreover it should be able to recognize and decode different file formats as PNG, JPG, TIFF and etc. The essential packages regarding to image processing can be installed as below:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">Image Processing Libraries * sudo apt-get install libpng3 pngtools libpng12-dev libpng12-0 libpng++-dev * sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev libtiff5 libtiff-tools * sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev libjpeg8 libjpeg8-dbg * sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev libjasper-runtime * sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev libjasper-runtime</div>

Some numbers are shown for package indications. For example _libtiff5-dev_ has number five. These available version must be change regarding to the root system which might be different in different Ubuntu versions and different updates. ### IV - Installing video processing libraries Same as images, for read/write and process videos the relevant dependencies must be installed as follows:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">Video Processing Libraries * sudo apt-get install libavformat-dev libavutil-dev * sudo apt-get install libxine2-dev libxine2 * sudo apt-get install libdc1394-22 libdc1394-22-dev libdc1394-utils</div>

The corresponding codecs have to be installed too:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">Video Codec * sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev * sudo apt-get install libfaac-dev libmp3lame-dev * sudo apt-get install libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev * sudo apt-get install libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev libxvidcore-dev * sudo apt-get install ffmpeg x264 libx264-dev * sudo apt-get install libv4l-0 v4l-utils</div>

### V - Installing multi-processing library TBB is a library for leveraging multi-core processing. OpenCV supports that so it is beneficial to install it.

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">Multi-Processing Library * sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev</div>

## Download OpenCV from source To download OpenCV from source there are two ways to do it. The first one is to download the zip package and then unzip it with the following commands:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">Download OpenCV as a zip file from the source * wget -O opencv3.zip https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/3.1.0.zip * unzip opencv3.zip</div>

Noted that _opencv3.zip_ is the name that the <span class="inner_shadow">unzip</span> command will save the download zip with that name. The direct way to download the OpenCV from the source is as follows:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">OpenCV direct download from the source * git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git * unzip opencv3.zip</div>

There is a small difference in the first and second method. The former one target a specific version of OpenCV which is <span class="inner_shadow">3.1.0</span> but the later one download the latest version. For convenience we use the former method because it is more customized. At the moment it is necessary to download <span class="inner_shadow">opencv_contrib</span> too:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">Downloading opencv_contrib * wget -O opencv_contrib.zip https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib/archive/3.1.0.zip * unzip opencv_contrib.zip</div>

At this moment the OpenCV is downloaded from the source and it ready to be compiled. ## Compiling OpenCV From now on we have to be in the virtual environment and it should be activated by the command <span class="inner_shadow">source activate py3k</span>. Make sure that the environment is active and the sign is as mention in [Fig. 1](#figure1). Now it the time to go to <span class="inner_shadow">opencv directory</span> and create a dir name <span class="inner_shadow">build directory</span> to build and compile the necessary elements for OpenCV installation. The command is as below:

<div class="shell-wrap">Build a directory for compiling OpenCV * cd ~/opencv-3.1.0/ <out>~/opencv-3.1.0$</out> * mkdir build/ * cd build/ <out>~/opencv-3.1.0/build$</out></div>

For comiling OpenCV both <span class="inner_shadow">cmake</span> and <span class="inner_shadow">ccmake</span> can be used. The preference in this tutorial is to use the later one due to better graphical illustrations. ### (I) Using cmake command The first one can be use for initialization of important options. We start by using the <span class="inner_shadow">ccmake</span> command:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 700px">Build a directory for compiling OpenCV * cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \ -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \ -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \ -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=OFF \ -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_contrib-3.1.0/modules \ -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..</div>

The implementation of cmake command can be something similar to above, however the preference is to use the GUI as mentioned before and will be demonstrated in the subsequent section. ### (II) Using cmake GUI: ccmake .. The executed commands could be run by <span class="inner_shadow">ccmake ..</span> command in a much easier way. Let's run it in the terminal":

<div class="shell-wrap">ccmake as graphical interface * ccmake ..</div>

When the interface showed up, the configuration with <span class="inner_shadow">button c</span> has to be done to run the <span class="inner_shadow">make interface</span>. The a screen as below will come up:

<div align="center">

<div id="figure2" class="responsive" style="padding: 0 6px;width: 80%;">

<div class="img">[![Linkedin](../../../_images/topics/computer_vision/installation/opencv/ccmakemain.png)](../../../_images/topics/computer_vision/installation/opencv/ccmakemain.png)

<div class="desc">**Figure 2:** The GUI for cmake command in order to compile OpenCV.</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

Some options here have to found and changed. Some options have to checked to be correct if not changed. The options are shown as below:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 800px">compile options <out>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE</out> <out>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local</out> <out>INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON</out> <out>INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=OFF</out> <out>PYTHON3_EXECUTABLE = /home/sina/anaconda/envs/py3k/bin/python3</out> <out>PYTHON3_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/sina/anaconda/envs/py3k/include/python3</out> <out>PYTHON3_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so</out> <out>PYTHON3_NUMPY_INCLUDE_DIRS=/home/sina/anaconda/envs/py3k/lib/python3.5/site-packages/numpy/core/include</out> <out>OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=/home/sina/opencv_contrib-3.1.0/modules</out> <out>WITH_CUDA=OFF</out> <out>BUILD_EXAMPLES = ON</out> <out>BUILD_LIBPROTOBUF_FROM_SOURCES = ON</out> <out>BUILD_opencv_hdf = OFF</out></div>

As it is obvious in the above options, the <span class="inner_shadow">PYTHON3</span> related options are targeted and it is because we are working on a python3 environment. The options <span class="inner_shadow">PYTHON3_EXECUTABLE</span>, <span class="inner_shadow">PYTHON3_INCLUDE_DIR</span> and <span class="inner_shadow">PYTHON3_NUMPY_INCLUDE_DIRS</span> must refer to the _corresponding virtual environment_ path although the <span class="inner_shadow">PYTHON3_LIBRARY</span> must refer to the _corresponding root path_ and otherwise is not acceptable by the cmake command. The <span class="inner_shadow">WITH_CUDA</span> and <span class="inner_shadow">BUILD_opencv_hdf</span> options turned to off due to some likely incompatibilities but OpenCV can be compiled using CUDA too. Anytime that you change couple of options in the GUI, configure the structure by pressing **c** button. <span class="inner_shadow">BUILD_LIBPROTOBUF_FROM_SOURCES = ON</span> is one of the options that was recommended by the cmake GUI after running the configure button. After running the configuration, the generation option will appear as below:

<div align="center">

<div id="figure3" class="responsive" style="padding: 0 6px;width: 80%;">

<div class="img">[![Linkedin](../../../_images/topics/computer_vision/installation/opencv/cmakegenerate.png)](../../../_images/topics/computer_vision/installation/opencv/cmakegenerate.png)

<div class="desc">**Figure 3:** Generation Option Appearance.</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

After generation of the make file, it is time to make and basically compile the OpenCV using the following comman:

<div class="shell-wrap">Compiling OpenCV * make -j8</div>

The option <span class="inner_shadow">-jX</span> depends on system architecture and it employs parallel computing for faster processing. The screen shot of compiling process is as below:

<div align="center">

<div id="figure4" class="responsive" style="padding: 0 6px;width: 80%;">

<div class="desc">**Figure 4:** Compiling Process.</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

## Installing OpenCV The last step is to install OpenCV using the following commands:

<div class="shell-wrap">Installing OpenCV * sudo make install * sudo ldconfig</div>

The command <span class="inner_shadow">sudo ldconfig</span> is necessary to maintain the <emph>shared library cashe</emph>. ## OpenCV Package Binding OpenCV3 - Python binding should be located in the folder <span class="inner_shadow">/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/</span>. It can be verified by:

<div class="shell-wrap">Installing OpenCV * ls /usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/ <out>cv2.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so</out></div>

As it is obvious, the name of the library file is <span class="inner_shadow">cv2.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so</span> which needs to be changed to <span class="inner_shadow">cv2.so</span> as prompt by the python environment. This task can be done by make a copy of the file in the same folder and with another name:

<div class="shell-wrap">Installing OpenCV * cd /usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages// * sudo cp cv2.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so cv2.so</div>

After this phase, the <span class="inner_shadow">cv2.so</span> has to be moved to the right directory which is corresponding to the relevant Anaconda virtual environment. In out specific case, it can be done by the following procedure:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 700px">Installing OpenCV * cd ~/anaconda/envs/py3k/lib/python3.5/site-packages * ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/cv2.so cv2.so</div>

The first command take us to the desired environment library and the second one makes symbolic link between the two files. In order to grasp a better idea of what is <span class="inner_shadow">ln -s</span> and how it works please refer to [this official ubuntu documentation](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/ln.1.html). ## Testing OpenCV Installation In order to test OpenCV, we have to activate the virtual environment first. The output must include the environment indicator as we discussed before.

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 700px">Activating Anaconda Virtual Environment * source activate py3k <out>(py3k) username@pc_name:~$</out></div>

Then the version can be checked by the following:

<div class="shell-wrap" style="width: 700px">Check OpenCV and its Installed Version * python * import cv2 * cv2.__version__ <out>'3.1.0'</out></div>

## Summary Now the OpenCV3 is installed in Anaconda virtual environment. This virtual environment installation helps to avoid likely conflicts between packages between different projects and more over enrich the user with the user friendly environment of <span class="inner_shadow">conda</span>.</article>
